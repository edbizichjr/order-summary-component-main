## My process

I first started by dragging the design reference into Figma to get an idea for spacing. Then I went and started blocking things out in HTML is what made sense to me. After that iI started writing my css and things started to come together.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### Continued development

I want to continue to focus on ways to streamline my CSS and make things more organized and use less lines of code.
